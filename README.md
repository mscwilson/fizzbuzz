# FizzBuzz

The classic FizzBuzz problem, in Ruby.
A method/function that takes a number, and returns "Fizz" if the number divides by 3, "Buzz" if it divides by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if it divides evenly by both 3 and 5.  

[Katy Day](https://github.com/day-katy) and I wrote this together as our first introduction to pair programming, and our first introduction to tests (using the rspec library). It was part of the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) coding bootcamp.

To run the code:
* Clone this repo and navigate into the cloned folder
* Run `irb -r ./lib/fizzbuzz.rb`
* Test different numbers, e.g. 5 by running `fizzbuzz(5)`
* Run the tests with `rspec`
